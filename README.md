## A Django webapp for a mockup restaurant

I made this Django project for a Backend course assessment.
This little webapp is a dynamic website for a restaurant called Little Lemon. It allows users to view the menu and some informations about the restaurant.
The users may book a reservation and the app will save all the customer's data to a sqlite model.
